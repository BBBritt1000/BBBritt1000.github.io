<p>Hello, as you probably know people tend to have stuff with them, Link is no different.  Let’s look at what Link carries around in his satchel wherever he goes.  Before we get it to it, let me make this clear, we will not be discussing the Master Sword or the Hylian shield.  Thank you, now without further ado, let’s get into it.</p>

<p style="color:Tomato;">First up is offense.</p style="color:Tomato;">Link has tons of different options at his disposal. First, he has his trusty bow and arrow. He has multiple types of arrows:  electric, fire, ice, and silver arrows, which have magical powers to dispel evil.  He often carries around bombs, which can be used to blow up rocks in the way or against enemies.  Another powerful ability is called Urbosa’s Fury, when that happens tons of lightning strikes down in the area stunning or defeating enemies.  One of Link’s greatest items is the Shika Slate, which is about the size of a phone.  It can summon remote bombs, which can then be detonated with the Shika Slate.  It can also magnetically control metal objects, take pictures, summon his super cycle zero, make pillars of ice, and most incredibly, can freeze any object in time for a short period.  One of the most powerful items is The Giant’s Mask, when worn Link grows to a gargantuan size of 70ft.  His attack power is doubled, and his defense is tripled.</p>

<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Link also covers his bases with strong defensive items.</p style="color:DodgerBlue;">

<p>The Kane of Byrna is one, which gives the user a magical force field that protects them from all attacks round them, as long as their magic bar has some magic in it.  A champion of old gave Link the ability Duruk’s Protection. Link will take a defensive stance and a temporary force field will block the next blow that hits the force field.  Next, Link has a defensive relic so powerful that when worn, it gives the wearer invisiblitiy, the cloak of invisibility. It also makes him intangible, but Link cannot attack enemies in this state.  Additionally, Link may have extreme attack power and a sturdy defense, but sometimes his health gets low.  But never fear, Link has healing items so that he can continue the good fight.  Let’s look at them now.  When Link needs health and magic, he drinks the omega blue potion.  It’s extremely expensive but will restore his hearts and magic meter to full, making him ready to jump into the fray again. However, if he or his allies ever happen to fall in battle, he also has bottled up fairies. They will revive him if he dies, or he can let them out of their bottles and have them heal his allies.  Another champion of old gave Link another ability,  Mifa’s Grace.  If he has used up all his fairies, this is his last resort, because it will heal the wound that killed him. Then alylong with healing the rest of his hearts, it will give him a temporary bonus of five golden hearts.</p>

<p style="color:brown;">Finally, Link carries around a number of miscellaneous items, several weird and wacky pieces of junk.</p style="color:brown;">

One of the most well known is his ocarina.  He can play multiple tunes to change the weather, teleport, or even summon his horse Elpon.  The paraglider is another item he carries.  He can jump off mountains and glide through the air.  It is primarily a mode of transportation, but he can briefly stop gliding, shoot arrows while falling through the air, only to grab the glider and start gliding again.  The hook claws are a pair of glove like claws, which are connected to a chain.  This allows him to pull enemies toward him to fight, or to pull himself to objects.  The last item he carries is the Magical Hammer.  When Link smashes it against the ground, he can flip any little creatures over in the area so that he can get to their underside for a finishing blow.  One other purpose it can fulfill is stun larger enemies, so that you can outmaneuver them.  Overall, Link’s satchel of junk holds a cornucopia of items.</p>
